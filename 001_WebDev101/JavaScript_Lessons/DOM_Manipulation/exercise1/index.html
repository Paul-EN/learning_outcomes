    <!-- Method 1: This solution is less than ideal because we're cluttering our HTML with JavaScript. Also, we can only have 1 "onclick" event per element. -->
    <button id="btn2">2) Click Me</button>
    <!-- Method 2: This is a little better. We've moved the JS out of the HTML and into a JS file, but we still have the problem that a DOM element can only have 1 "onclick" property. -->
    <button id="btn3">3) Click Me</button>
    <!-- Method 3: Now, we maintaines separation of concerns, and we also allow multiple event listeners if need arise. Method 3 is much more flexible and powerful, thoigh it is a bit more complex to set up. -->
    <!-- Note that all 3 of these  -->
    <button onclick='alertFunction()'>4) Click Me</button>
    <button id='btn5'>5) Click Me</button>
    <button id='btn6'>6) Click Me</button>
    <!-- Using named functions can clean up your code considerable, and is a really good idea if the function is something that you are going to want to do in multiple places.

    With all three methods we can access more information about the event by passing a parameter to the function that we are calling. -->
    <button id='btn7'>7) Click Me</button>
