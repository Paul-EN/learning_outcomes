    <p>A simple page put together using simple HTML</p>

    <h2>Why this is</h2>
    <ul> <!-- To create bulleted lists, use <ul> (unordered list) with its corresponding elemetns using <li> (list) tags nested inside -->
      <li>To learn HTML</li>
      <li>To show off</li>
        <ol> <!-- To create numbered lists, use <ol> (ordered list) with its corresponding <li> elements -->
          <li>To my boss</li>
          <li>To my friends</li>
          <li>To my dog</li>
          <li>To the little talking duck in my brain, Darkwing</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Because I've fallen in love with my computer and want to give her some HTML loving.</li>
    </ul> <!-- <ul> and <ol> can be nested within other elements -->

    <!-- form defines the form and within this tag, if you are using a form for a user to submit information (which we are assuming at this level), an action attribute is needed to tell the form wshere its contents will be sent to. -->
    <!-- The method attribute tells the form how the data in it is going to be sent and it can have the value get, which is default, and latches the form information onto a web address, or post, which (essentially) invisibly sends the form's information. -->
    <!-- get is used for shorter chunks of non-sensitive information - you might see the information you have submitted in a web site's search to appear in the web address of its search results page, for example. -->
    <!-- post is used for lengthier, more secure submissions, such as in contact forms. -->
    <!-- Example:
    <form action="processingscript.php" method="post">

    </form>
    -->
    
  </body>
