- Span and Div -
HTML is all about applying meaning to content. Whereas most HTML tags apply meaning (p make a paragraph, h1 makes a heading etc.), the span and div tags apply no meaning at all. This might sound about as useful as a foam hammer but they are actually used quite extensively in conjunction with CSS.

They are used to group together a chunk of HTML and hook some information onto that chunk, most commonly with the attributes class and id to associate the element with a class or id CSS selector.

The difference between span and div is that span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is a block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

Example:
  <div id="scissors">
    <p>This is <span class="paper">crazy></span</p>
  </div>

div, and especially span, shouldn't actually be used that often. Whenever there is a sensible alternative that should be used instead. For example, if you want to emphasize the word "crazy" and the class "paper" is adding italics for visual emphasis, then, for richer, more meaningful content, the code might look like this:

Example:
  <div id="scissors">
    <p>This is <em class="paper">crazy</em></p>
  </div>

- Text: Abbreviations, Quotations, and Code -
Abbreviations
abbr is used to markup an abbreviation, a shortened for of a word or phrase.
The expanded phrase that the abbreviation represents can be defined in the value of the title attribute.
This is optional but recommended.

Example:
  <p>This web site is about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>

Quotations
blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.
If the source of the quotation can be found on the Web, the cite attribute can be used to point to its origin.

Example:
  <blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
    <p>blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  Blockquotes work very nicely with the HTML5 elements figure and figcaption, enabling a nice, semantic way to group a quotation with a citation.
  <figure>
    <blockquote>[Big old quotation about evolution]</blockquote>
    <figcaption>Charles Darwin</figcaption>
  </figure>

  Citations
  Just to make things nice and confusing, as well as a cite attribute, there is also a cite tag.
  This can be used to define the title of a work, such as a book.

  Example:
    <p>According to <cite>the Bible</cite>, after six days God said <q>screw this for a lark, I'm having a nap</q>.</p>

Code
code is used to represent any form of computer code. Further, var can be used to variables (which could be a variable in anything, not just in code - it could be a variable in an equation, for example), samp for sample output, and kbd (keyboard) for user input.

<p>If you add the line <code><var>givevaderachuckle</var> = true;</code> to the <code>destroy_planet</code> subroutine and then type <kbd>ilovejabba</kbd> into the console, the big bad green Death Star laser will etch <samp>Slug Lover!</samp> on the planet's surface.</p>

Preformatted text
pre is preformatted text and is usually in HTML tags it takes notice of every character in it, including the white space (whereas other elements will ignore a consecutive space or a line-break, for example). It is most commonly used for blocks of code, where spacing, such as indentations, can be relevant.

Example:
  <pre><code>
    &lt;div id="intro"%gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Some heading&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some paragraph paragraph thing thing thingy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  </code></pre>

As an example, pre and code are used extensively throughout this site. The code blocks, such as the one above, are code elements inside pre elements. In-line references to tags and properties are simply code elements, often inside a elements to link to the reference section.
