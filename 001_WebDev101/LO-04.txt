Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment:

    What are the seven data types of javascript?
      JavaScript's seven data types are:
        String - Typically text
        Number - Numerical values
        Boolean - true/false values
        Object - A variable that contains multiple other variables within, aka properties.
        Array - An assortment of values or reserved memory
        Null - No valid string, number, boolean, array, or object. Can be used to erase contents of a variable by assigning it null.
        Undefined - A variable that has been declared without a value or an object property that doesn't exit.

    Which data type is NOT primitive?
        Boolean and array are composite data types as they can comprise of multiple values.
        Null and undefined are considered special data types as they can serve as placeholders for non-existent values.

    What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?
        There is very little difference between single and double quotes, and both can be interchanged. Although, when using single quotes, you may run into problems with punctuation marks for example:
          let string0 = 'That's great'; Here the computer will think the quote is only 'That'
            A way around this is to escape the quote with a \
              let string0 = 'That\'s great';
          let string1 = "That's great"; Here the computer will have no issue recognizing the quote

        Backtick quotes can be used to identify template literals, which allow you to use them as multi-line and can include "interpolation" to insert the content of variables.
        Example:
          var name = "Paul";
          var phrase = "What is your name?";
          var string = `Hi, my name is ${name}.
                        ${phrase}`
          This will return:
            Hi, my name is Paul.
            What is your name?

    Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions into a string?
        The backtick quote as explained in the previous question.

    How do you embed variables/expressions into a string?
        ${variable name here}

    How do you escape characters in a string?
        By using backslash \

    What is the difference between slice/substring/substr?
        slice and substring are very similar in that they both have the same format for parameters (start, end), but they differ in how they interpret negative numbers.
        With slice, if you use a negative number to start, it will begin counting from the end of the string.
        With substring, it will simply default to the beginning of the string.

        With substr, the format is a little different. Here we specify the start and the how many characters we want to extract after it. If a negative start value is entered, it begins counting from the end of the string.
        Example:
          String.substr(start, length);

    What are methods?
        Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
        For example:
          var message = "HeLlO wOrLd"
          var x = message.toLowerCase();
          // x results as "hello world"

    What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
        && - AND - is used when you want both (or more) conditions to all be true
        || - OR  - is used when you want at least one of both (or more) conditions to be true
        !  - NOT - is used when you want to specify the opposite boolean value (i.e. true becomes false and false-true)

    What are the comparison operators?
        ==  returns true if both variables are the same value
        === returns true if both variables are the same value and type
        !=  returns true if both variables are not the same
        !== returns true if both variables are not the same value or type
        >   greater than
        >=  equal to or greater than
        <   less than
        <=  equal to or less than

    What is nesting?
        Nesting is when you put piece of code inside another piece of code.
        Example 1:
          <p>This is a <strong>test</strong></p>
            Here the bold tags are nesting inside the paragraph tags.
        Example 2:
          if (x > y) {
            if (b == a) {
              return a;
            } else {
                return x;
              }
          } else if (c != d) {
              return y;
            } else {
                return z;
              }
            Here, an if and else statement is nested within another if statement with its own else if and else statements afterwards.

    What are truthy and falsy values?
        A truthy value is a value that translates to true when evaluated in a Boolean context.
        A falsy value is a value that translates to false.
        Example:
        let x = new Boolean(1); // 1 is true, so truthy
        let x = new Boolean("Hello"); // true, so truthy
        let x = new Boolean("0"); // "0" is a valid string which is true, so truthy
        let x = new Boolean(0); // 0 is false, so falsy
        let x = new Boolean(""); // "" is a blank string which is false, so falsy

    What are the falsy values in Javascript?
        falsy values are false, 0, "" (blank string), null, undefined, NaN (Not-a-Number), and document.all [1].

    What is the syntax for an if/else if/else conditional?
        if (condition) {
          code to execute;
        } else if (condition) {
          code to execute if first condition is not met;
        } else {
          last code alternative to execute if no other conditions are met;
        }

    What is the syntax for a switch statement?
        switch (expression) {
          case (condition):
            code to execute;
            break; // ends switch iteration if case condition is met and code is executed
          case (condition):
            code to execute if condition of the previous case is not met;
            break;
          default:
            code to execute if conditions of all other cases are not met;
        }

    What is the syntax for a ternary operator?
        let variable1 = (condition) ? code to execute if condition is met : code to execute if condition is not met;

    What is the relationship between null and undefined?
        null is a special type of object that represents 'no value'
          let x = null; // x is assigned no value
        undefined is a variable that has been declared but has no specified value.
          let x; // x exists, but has no value

    What are conditionals?
        Conditionals are the if, else if, else, and switch statements used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
